## 👋 Hi there 

Welcome to my README.md! My name is Kelly Brown. I am a software quality assurance engineer with almost a decade of experience testing software and driving quality, and I am currently seeking remote work opportunities.


```
class QualityAssurance(object):

    def __init__(self, name, title, location, experience):
        self.name = name
        self.title = title
        self.location = location
        self.experience = experience
        print(f"{name} from {location}, who has {experience} of professional quality assurance is looking for a {title} role.")

Kelly_Brown = QualityAssurance('Kelly Brown', 'Software Quality Assurance Engineer', 'New Hampshire, USA', '9+ years of experience')
```

##  💼 I am currently working on
